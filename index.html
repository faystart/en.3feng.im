        <p>For Caijing.com, there aren’t any good news in these days: <a href="http://www.donews.com/Content/200910/d933301cd4504a0a9f14683fcc560e0b.shtm" target="_blank" rel="external">the whole middle mangement level quit, and Ms.Hu Shuli, who was the funder may be fore to resign</a>(Chinese website). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/media/13chinamag.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss" target="_blank" rel="external">The New York Times report:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caijing, a respected Chinese business magazine, has been thrown into turmoil after a dispute over its editorial policy and business governance led to the resignation of 11 high-ranking executives and nearly 70 other workers from the business staff, according to people close to the magazine. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This news was spread quickly via internet. the <a href="http://business.sohu.com/20091013/n267306613.shtml" target="_blank" rel="external">Finace.Sohu.com wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>胡舒立本人在最新的《中国新闻周刊》上发表了一篇文章，题目是《无法确定的愿景》。文章有几句话：”我觉得媒体的批评权、公众的知情权远远大于利益集团自赋的或他赋的历史使命。””我又希望媒体有更大的空间，不承担那么多的压力，媒体人可以安心而尽职地履行媒体责任。””我只想，应当无愧于未来，其余的只有后人来说、来做了。”这篇文章是回顾其媒体理念成熟的轨迹及《财经》杂志的发展过程的，标题及这些关键的句子，似乎隐含了某种无奈的表达。 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translate brief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms.Hu Shuli had said, I think the right to criticize of media, the right to know of public should be more important than the historic mission of interest group, no matter it given by itself or others. I hope there will be more room for media, instead of pressure, the media people can do their own job confidently. I just think, I should not be shame in future, the rest will be given to later people. It is a hopeless expression. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As many people knowing, Caijing is the most powerful magazine which famous by its outspoken in the Silent China Media. All media need to attactch to a governmental unit, cause the single person could not publish a magazine on his/her own.</p>
<p>This time, as the report wrote, Ms.Hu leave, as reason of pressure form stockholder.But no news on the stock sharing had any problem. So, maybe the cesorship of government should be the real problem.</p>
<p>From the article above in Sohu.com, Ms. Hu will set up the other media portal with the resigning staff in Caijing. The difficult is, there are not two same river in the world, in the other times, can another Caijing born?</p>
<p>If Ms.Hu leave, and her staff too. the sad it is, Caijing’s future, anyone cares? May be not, cause the room reduce, can any media could tell the True in China? If Caijing change to be another CCTV, it sucks.</p>

<p>The author writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for us, there are firms like GE who not only have a passion for CSR, but also for measuring everything, and fortunately they were willing to share their most recent results.Results that will go a long way to show how through their programs they are effectively engaging their employees, developing long term programming, and building the internal branding of their firm. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the key reasons why GE is so successful in driving volunteerism, is simply because employees are the greatest supporters of this meaningful initiative.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of this year, we conducted the 2008 Greater China Volunteer Survey to listen more closely to employees’ voices, and collect their opinions in order to make more future improvements </p>

        <p>If you living in China, and if you can link with internet, you will see these 3 weapon which were born in Netizen’s language. Orz, ofcourse, you need to know Chinese. The 3 most dangerous weapons are: 俯卧撑（push up）、打酱油(buying sauce)、躲猫猫(hide-and-seek)。</p>
<p>You know, China mainland is a place which fullfill fantasy and maricles. And the internet in China is the last free world of Chinese netizen. For many reasons, netizen in China have to creat some new words to conclude many things which are more and more absurd.</p>
<p>For example, the 3 most dangerous weapons in history.  And the first is ： 俯卧撑。 In <a href="http://virtualreview.org/china/zoom/634386/riot-in-wengan-county-guizhou-province" target="_blank" rel="external">Wengan Case</a>, netizen pick 俯卧撑 from the official report which  power by Guizhou Police Department. As the report said, Li Shufen was killed by 俯卧撑( after she do 3 push up in the birgde, she die in the river ). From that on, 俯卧撑 was used in many ways. It just like a dangerous weapon.  netizen write it in their IM signture : the newest weapon:俯卧撑。And sometime, it was used like: Do Not doing 3 俯卧撑 in Midnight, or you will die abnormly.</p>
<p>The second weapon is:打酱油。It was born in the <a href="http://zonaeuropa.com/20080209_1.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">Sex Photos Gate </a>which happen in Hongkong. It is a kiding word. when a citizen was interview about the photos in Guangzhou, he said, it is no concered of mine about the fucking sex photos. And from that on, many people used 打酱油 as comments in many post and news. It means, No Comments or I Can Not any about it.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-CN&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=aff-cs-worldbrowser&amp;hs=lch&amp;q=%E8%BA%B2%E7%8C%AB%E7%8C%AB&amp;btnG=Google+%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2&amp;aq=f&amp;oq==f&amp;oq=" target="_blank" rel="external">躲猫猫</a>？Yeap, it is really a dangerous weapon. It was born in Yunnan Province. One man die in the police station, and he was injurned badly before he die. And the Great Fucking Police Station Claim, that guy die in the hide-and-seek game in Police station. So that 躲猫猫 became new dangerous weapon in China. When it was born, the media said, how  great the imagination is. People can die in Hide-and-Seek game,  and what things can not kill people?</p>
<p>These are 3 most dangerous weapon in the Chinese History, so , what’s your comments?</p>

From 2004 to 2007, in 4 years, it profited growth 68.28%. but who know, the profit including how many sweat of Chinese cheap labor. And now , there is a investigation report about how Adidas profit, the report including how to use labor, welfare and working security.</div><br><div> </div><br><div><strong>Adidas sweatshop investigation</strong></div><br><div>Li Qiang</div><br><div>Background:</div><br><div> </div><br><div>Adidas is a multinational company who from Germany, it was famous for its shoes and sportswear. The shoes and sportswear are very popular in the world. It was respected as an Great famous sport band. 2004, Adidas had $646,770,453 profit. And in 2007, its profit had grown to $1,088,393,584 (go beyond one billion ), 4 years, the growth rate has reach 68.28% (all data from Adidas annul financial report )</div><br><div>In China, there are 200 factories, more than 250,000 labors working for Adidas. in the report form CLW, no matter in Chengda, Weili and Changyelong (the factory name in China), there is a similarity: all labors’ pay were so bad. though only 3 factories were investigated, but we can drew the picture for the suppliers of Adidas.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>Most Adidas workers are female, about 20 years old, come from rural, just work in the factories which like Chengda, Weili, Changyelong ect.</div><br><div>They work 6 days every week for average, and everyday they work about 10 to 12 hours. They live in the staff dormitories. Every dormitory has 10 people, use a public bathroom. They have no pension. The workers in Changyelong are worried about late, if late for 5 min, they will lost 2 hours wages. In Chengda, only when customer auditing, the security device such as glove and mask were sent. And worse, the staff in Chengda could not choice diet autonomous, cause the factory will subtract their dinner money although they don’t know.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>Some Adidas suppliers such as Chengda, declares, the staff work overtime is voluntary, because their salary was so low that they can’t help work overtime for survive and their family. They will not image if they can have an Adidas shoe or others products, though they produced them. If they want have, but it is impossible. Confront the low salary , frequently penalty of suppliers and long time working, the worker just hope the factory will pay the deserved salary.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>The real profit holder in Olympic, it could never be the 250,000 workers in Adidas production line. Instead, it is the profiteer companies such as Adidas, they got the biggest profit by cut down the labor cost. Now, Adidas is planning move the produce line to other countries, workers were bled white. They leave the responsibility to China.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>For sponsor the Olympic, Adidas had spent $74,567,918, and look at the workers’ low salary, no more than 65 cents every hour, it is not too hard image, how can Adidas sponsor Olympic, where were the money from, they all from 250,000 workers in China. Adidas use 3.5 months salary of the workers to sponsor Olympic. Adidas gain all repute and wealth, but the worker working day and night in the production line, to earn the additional cent.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>Who is the biggest beneficiary in Olympic? Neither the common audience who have the chance to see the success and failure of athletes, nor the athletes who win the games. Instead, in the Olympic which stand for peace and hope, the biggest beneficiary is the company such as Adidas. But , the staff who work in the suppliers’ factories, they cannot look for peace and hope.</div><br><div> </div><br><div>For that, CLW investigated the working condition in factories of Adidas suppliers : Changyelong sport goods company ltd. Weili textile company ltd of Zhongshan, Chengda shoes industry company ltd. From the report of CLW investigated the 3 factories, the conditions of the workers in Adidas suppliers factories were relative bad, the suppliers did not restrict the factories according to the standards of Adidas. The condition is unpromising, instead , Chinese workers only have the low and cheap salary, the additional work overtime, the paid lodging and boarding, the indemnification with no social insurance, hard to ask for leave, fine, the salary was docked, no security measure.</div><br><div>Impossible is nothing ,the ad word of Adidas, but form the report of CLW, the investigation on Chengda, Weili, Changyelong, for Adidas itself, one thing is impossible, give the humanity working conditions, it look likes impossible?</div><br><div> </div><br><div><strong>translated by <a href="http://faydao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">Faydao</a>.the text will come soon</strong></div><br><div><span>Technorati : <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Adidas" target="_blank" rel="external">Adidas</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/sweatshop" target="_blank" rel="external">sweatshop</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/%E8%A1%80%E6%B1%97%E5%B7%A5%E5%8E%82" target="_blank" rel="external">血汗工厂</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/%E9%98%BF%E8%BF%AA%E8%BE%BE%E6%96%AF" target="_blank" rel="external">阿迪达斯</a></span><br><span>Del.icio.us : <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/Adidas" target="_blank" rel="external">Adidas</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/sweatshop" target="_blank" rel="external">sweatshop</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/%E8%A1%80%E6%B1%97%E5%B7%A5%E5%8E%82" target="_blank" rel="external">血汗工厂</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/%E9%98%BF%E8%BF%AA%E8%BE%BE%E6%96%AF" target="_blank" rel="external">阿迪达斯</a></span></div>

        <p>from my mail.</p>
<p><strong>China**</strong>to ban small coal mines to improve pit safety**</p>
<p>BEIJING- China is to ban the building of coal mines with high gas danger whose annual production capacity would be below 300,000 tonnes, according to a new guideline for coal mine safety, the State Administration of Work Safety told Xinhua on Thursday.</p>
<p>The country plans to cut the death toll from coal mine gas blasts by at least 20 percent by 2010, compared with the 2007 figures, according to the coal mine safety guideline issued by the work safety commission of the State Council, or the Cabinet.</p>
<p>Coal mine accidents killed 3,770 people last year, among whom 1,084 people died from gas blasts, statistics from the administration showed.</p>
<p>The guideline orders large-scale coal mines to set up their own rescue teams, while smaller mines must work with neighbouring rescue teams to guarantee prompt rescue in case of any accident.</p>
<p>It also urged newly-built coal mines to build underground emergency shelters for miners, providing food, water, oxygen, communication facilities and other necessities.</p>
<p>The government has vowed to close more than 4,000 small coal mines to reduce their total number to less than 10,000 by 2010 in a bid to improve industry safety.</p>
<p>Chinahas about 16,000 coal mines, 90 percent of which are classified as small ones, and their safety record is far worse than that of large mines.</p>
<p><strong>Green axe hangs over local officials</strong></p>
<p>About 60 percent provincial and regional government officials’ career success depends on their achievements in saving energy and protecting the environment, a top development official said Thursday.</p>
<p>The central government announced last year that local government officials’ promotions would depend not only on economic growth, but also on their environmental efforts. Which means they will not be promoted if they fail to achieve their green targets.</p>
<p>Xie Zhenhua, vice-minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, said the progress made since is a “great achievement” despite some local officials’ “slow response”.</p>
<p>Chinahas vowed to cut its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 percent by 2010.</p>
<p>It also vowed to cut pollutant emission by 10 percent during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-10).<br>The central government has told all provinces and autonomous regions to cut their share, taking the 2005 level as the benchmark. So “the local governments’ performance is vital to the nation’s goal”, Xie said.<br>But the energy saving story is still “grim”, Xie said, even though the officials’ performances are yet to be assessed. They will be judged on a five-yearly basis.<br>In 2006, China managed to reduce the use of energy by 1.23 percent, though the target was 4 percent. It reached closer to its target last year, but still fell short by 0.34 percentage points.<br>The first half of this year saw a reduction of 2.88 percent, only 0.1 percentage point better year-on-year.</p>
<p><strong>77 applications, no protests at Beijing Games
</strong>Since Aug 1, Beijing authorities have received 77 applications from people wishing to stage demonstrations, a spokesperson for the municipal public security bureau said on Aug 18.<br>The applications involved 149 people, including three from overseas. Most of the applications concerned labor, medical and welfare issues, which is not applicable for protests according to Chinese law and should be dealt through available channels with government agencies, the spokesperson said.<br>For the three applications submitted by foreigners, “Two other applications have been suspended due to incomplete procedures. The other case concerned incomplete particulars.<br>Chinese law requires demonstrators to submit their requests at least five days in advance, detail the subject of protest, and provide basic information of the participants. Every participant have to appear in person when submitting the application.<br>Chinaannounced last month it would set up zones in three Beijing parks where demonstrators could legally stage protests during the Olympic Games. They are Zizhuyuan Park in the city’s northwest, Ritan Park in the east and World Park in the southwest. No protest has been allowed yet.</p>
<p><strong>Lending to small firms encouraged
</strong>The government has introduced new incentives to encourage more lenders to provide microcredit loans to labor-intensive small firms and laid-off workers starting new businesses.<br>In a joint statement, the People’s Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, said microcredit lenders are allowed to raise the lending rate by up to 3 percentage points more than the benchmark rate for loans granted since January 1 to laid-off workers starting new businesses.<br>The measures are part of the central government’s efforts to provide additional capital to encourage the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and create more jobs.<br>The government will shoulder the financial burden of interest charges levied on businesses with thin profit margins.<br>“SMEs are major engines of job creation in China,” said Zhou Dewen, director of the Wenzhou Council for the Development and Promotion of SMEs. “The introduction of new incentives for microcredit loans is good news for SMEs.”<br>Economists and industry experts said domestic enterprises still rely too heavily on bank loans to finance their growth. This reliance has seriously hampered the growth of many SMEs because banks traditionally prefer to lend to large State-owned enterprises.</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Eva has spent the last six months successfully galvanizing classmates to take action on some of the world’s most pressing issues. Along the way, the Stanford-bound senior has presented awards to red-clad classmates on World AIDS Day, recruited a refugee from Sudan’s troubled Darfur region to speak on a school panel, and stumped for universal primary education on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eva is no stranger to eye-opening awareness campaigns. She previously developed a theater workshop for teens that offers both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives on the Middle East’s defining conflict. But her commitment to civic engagement deepened last fall after she joined NetAid’s Global Citizen Corps, a national network of high school student leaders working to educate and mobilize their peers to end global poverty. Participating students organize events on a handful of &quot;Global Action Days&quot; throughout the school year, and swap ideas with peers on the organization’s Online Action Center. The deadline to apply is May 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eva learned about NetAid’s signature program from a fellow San Francisco Bay-area high schooler, whom she met at an East Coast leadership conference in 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;She had put on really big events at her school that raised awareness and money, and NetAid’s program sounded like a really good means to support them,&quot; explains Eva. &quot;I was really interested in issues of global poverty and Third-World development, partly because I was taking an environmental science class where I learned about overpopulation and water and all those issues we talk about in Global Citizenship Corps.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2004, according to NetAid, Global Citizen Corps leaders have had a tremendous impact on communities at home and abroad. They’ve educated more than 150,000 peers, raised tens of thousands of dollars to alleviate poverty, gathered thousands of petition signatures and generated dozens of stories in the local, regional and national press.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eva’s first goal after joining the Global Citizen Corps was to focus her schoolmates’ attention on World AIDS Day, which takes place each December 1. At 400-student Marin Academy in San Rafael, Calif., she circulated petitions, staffed an information table in the lunchroom and promoted a contest to see who could wear the most red. She also passed out different-colored stickers for classmates to wear, each representing a person with AIDS in a certain part of the world. At an all-school assembly that morning, she asked classmates with yellow stickers - who represented people with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa - to stand. The exercise presented a stark and relatable portrait of how the disease disproportionately impacts that part of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her efforts had an immediately tangible effect: classmates pitched in $500 to help girls in Zambia enroll in primary school, a proven strategy to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection. NetAid matched the amount, and contributions by teachers, parents and others pushed the total donation to $2,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I believed it before, but this event reinforced for me that a small group of determined people can really do a lot,&quot; Eva says. &quot;Five hundred dollars might not change the world, but it does make a difference in the life of someone who needs it most.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eva’s efforts continued in February with a two-person panel on Darfur, which featured a Sudanese refugee living in Oakland and a former official from the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR). The forum spurred sales of hats, t-shirts, bracelets and pins that raised money for UNHCR’s Darfur efforts. And just last month, Eva traveled to Washington, D.C., where she met with House and Senate staffers and urged them to do more to ensure universal primary education overseas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eva says the most fulfilling thing about her experience in the Global Citizen Corps is &quot;getting students who might not care about a cause and helping strike this chord in them. So, for example, they see this Sudanese refugee talking and they’re moved to take action.&quot;</p>
